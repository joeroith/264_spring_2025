    "text": "Version Control (GitHub)\nIn order to collaborate on an R project (or any coding project in general), data scientists typically use a version control system like GitHub. With GitHub, you never have to save files as Final.docx, Final2.docx, Newfinal.docx, RealFinal.docx, nothisisreallyit.docx, etc. You update code like .qmd and .Rmd and data files, recording descriptions of any changes. Then if you ever want to go back to an earlier version, GitHub can facilitate that. Or if you want to make your work public, others can see it and even suggest changes, but you are ultimately in control of any changes that get made.\nAnd, you can have multiple collaborators with access to the same set of files. While it can be dicey if multiple people have the file open and make changes at the same time, if you do this with GitHub, it is at least POSSIBLE to get it straightened out, and the second person who tries to save will get warned. If you are both just using a common folder on RStudio, you can easily write over and erase each other’s work. (If you use a common folder, be sure that one person is editing at a time to prevent this).\nIn order to begin to get familiar with GitHub, we will use it to create a personal website.\n\n\nGetting started on GitHub and connecting to RStudio\n\nCreate a GitHub account at github.com. It’s usually okay to hit “Skip Personalization” at the bottom of the screen after entering an email, username, and password. There are a few bonuses you can get as a student that you might consider.\nObtain a personal access token in GitHub using the following steps:\n\nClick your profile picture/symbol in the upper right of your GitHub page. Then select Settings &gt; Developer settings &gt; Personal access tokens &gt; Tokens (classic).\nClick “Generate new token” and give a descriptive name like “My PAT for RStudio”. Note that the default expiration is 30 days; I did a Custom setting through the end of the semester.\nSelect scopes and permissions; I often select: repo, workflow, gist, and user.\nClick “Generate token”. Copy your personal access token and store it somewhere.\n\nStore your credentials in RStudio using the following steps:\n\nIn the console, type library(credentials). You might have to install the credentials package first.\nThen type set_github_pat(), hit Return, choose the Token option, and copy in your personal access token\n\n\n\n\nCreating an R project (local) that’s connected to GitHub (cloud)\n\nIn your GitHub account, click the \\(+ \\nabla\\) (+down arrow) button near the top right and select New Repository (repo). For a personal website, you might put something like “proback.github.io” for your repository (repo) name, where you should replace proback with your GitHub user name. For other repos, choose simple but descriptive names that should avoid spaces. Be sure Public is checked; often I create Private repositories and turn them Public if I want later, but we know a personal webpage should be Public. Check Add a ReadMe File. Finally hit Create Repository and copy the URL once your repo has been created; the URL should be something like github.com/user_name/user_name.github.io.\nGo into your RStudio and select File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git. For the repository URL paste in the URL for the repository you just created. A project directory named “user_name.github.io” will be created in your specified folder (which you can navigate to).\n\nNotice that you are now starting with a blank slate! Nothing in the environment or history. Also note where it says your project name in the top right corner.\n\n\nCreating a personal website in RStudio (local)\n\nFollow the instructions here. These instructions use materials from Brianna Heggeseth at Macalester, Joyce Robbins at Columbia, and quarto documentation.\n\n\n\nPushing your work to GitHub (cloud)\n\nWe now want to “push” the changes made in “user_name.github.io” to your GitHub repo (the changes have only been made in your local RStudio for now).\n\nIn the console, type library(credentials)\nThen type set_github_pat(), hit Return, and copy in your personal access token. We do this again because we are in a new project. (These first two steps might not be necessary, but it’s good to make sure.)\nunder the Git tab in the Environment panel, check the boxes in front of all modified files to “stage” your changes\nclick the Commit tab to “commit” your changes (like saving a file locally) along with a message describing the changes you made. GitHub guides you by by showing your old code (red) and new code (green), to make sure you approve of the changes. This first time, all code should be green since we’ve only added new things rather than modifying previously saved files.\n“push” your changes to GitHub (an external website) by clicking the green Up arrow. Refresh your GitHub account to see new files in the user_name.github.io repo!\n\n\n\n\nModifying files that have already been pushed to GitHub\n\nMake a change (anything) to one of your files in RStudio. Now go back under the Git tab and “push” these new changes to GitHub. You’ll have to go through the same process of Stage, Commit, and Push, although this time you’ll see only your newest changes in green when you Commit. Confirm that your changes appear in GitHub.\n\n\n\nPulling work from GitHub\nBefore you start a new session of working on a project in RStudio, you should always Pull changes from GitHub first. Most of the time there will be nothing new, but if a collaborator made changes since the last time you worked on a file, you want to make sure you’re working with the latest and greatest version. If not, you’ll end up trying to Push changes made to an old version, and GitHub will balk and produce Merge Conflict messages. We’ll see how to handle Merge Conflicts later, but it’s a bit of a pain and best avoided!\n\nGo into one of your files on GitHub and hit the Edit icon. Add a line anywhere, and then scroll down to hit Commit Changes. (This is not recommended and for illustrative purposes only! You typically won’t edit directly in GitHub, but we’re emulating what might happen if a collaborator makes changes since the last time you worked on a document.) Now go back to RStudio and, under the Git tab, “Pull” the changes from GitHub into your R project folder. (Use the blue Down arrow). Confirm that your changes now appear in RStudio. Before you start working on the R server, you should always Pull any changes that might have been made on GitHub (especially if you’re working on a team!), since things can get dicey if you try to merge new changes from RStudio with new changes on GitHub.\n\n\n\nA bit more about R projects\n\nTo see the power of projects, select File &gt; Close Project and Don’t Save the workspace image. Then, select File &gt; Recent Projects &gt; user_name.github.io; you will get a clean Environment and Console once again, but History shows the commands you ran by hand, active Rmd and qmd files appear in the Source panel, and Files contains the Rmd, qmd, html, and csv files produced by your last session. And you can stage, commit and push the changes and the new file to GitHub!"
