    "text": "Ideally before class on Thurs Feb 8, and definitely before class on Tues Feb 13, you should follow these instructions to set up the software that we’ll be using throughout the semester. Even if you’ve already downloaded both R and RStudio, you’ll want to re-download to make sure that you have the most current versions.\n\nRequired: Download R and RStudio\n\nFIRST: Download R here.\n\nIn the top section, you will see three links “Download R for …”\nChoose the link that corresponds to your computer.\nAs of Feb 1, 2024, the latest version of R is 4.3.2 (“Eye Holes”).\n\nSECOND: Download RStudio here.\n\nClick the button under step 2 to install the version of RStudio recommended for your computer.\nAs of Feb 1, 2024, the latest version of RStudio is 2023.12.1 (Build 402).\n\nTHIRD: Check that when you go to File &gt; New Project &gt; New Directory, you see “Quarto Website” as an option.\n\n\nSuggested: Watch this video from Lisa Lendway at Macalester describing key configuration options for RStudio.\n\nSuggested: Change the default file download location for your internet browser.\n\nGenerally by default, internet browsers automatically save all files to the Downloads folder on your computer. In that case, you have to grab files from Downloads and move them to a more appropriate storage spot. You can change this option so that your browser asks you where to save each file before downloading it.\nThis page has information on how to do this for the most common browsers.\n\n\nRequired: Install required packages.\n\nAn R package is an extra bit of functionality that will help us in our data analysis efforts in a variety of ways. Many contributors create open source packages that can be added to base R to perform certain tasks in new and better ways.\nFor now, we’ll just make sure the tidyverse package is installed. Open RStudio and click on the Packages tab in the bottom right pane. inside the Console pane (by default, the bottom left pane). Click the Install button and type “tidyverse” (without quotes) in the pop-up box. Click the Install button at the bottom of the pop-up box.\nYou will see a lot of text from status messages appearing in the Console as the packages are being installed. Wait until you see the &gt; again.\nEnter the command library(tidyverse) in the Console and hit Enter.\n\nQuit RStudio. You’re done setting up!\n\n\nOptional: For a refresher on RStudio features, watch this video. It also shows you how to customize the layout and color scheme of RStudio."

For example, let’s consider state vaccination data from March 2021.\n\nvaccine_data &lt;- read_csv(\"Data/vacc_Mar21.csv\") \n\nvacc_mar13 &lt;- vaccine_data |&gt;\n  filter(Date ==\"2021-03-13\") |&gt;\n  select(State, Date, people_vaccinated_per100, share_doses_used, Governor)\n\nvacc_mar13\n\n# A tibble: 50 × 5\n   State       Date       people_vaccinated_per100 share_doses_used Governor\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;date&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n 1 Alabama     2021-03-13                     17.2            0.671 R       \n 2 Alaska      2021-03-13                     27.0            0.686 R       \n 3 Arizona     2021-03-13                     21.5            0.821 R       \n 4 Arkansas    2021-03-13                     19.2            0.705 R       \n 5 California  2021-03-13                     20.3            0.726 D       \n 6 Colorado    2021-03-13                     20.8            0.801 D       \n 7 Connecticut 2021-03-13                     26.2            0.851 D       \n 8 Delaware    2021-03-13                     20.2            0.753 D       \n 9 Florida     2021-03-13                     20.1            0.766 R       \n10 Georgia     2021-03-13                     15.2            0.674 R       \n# ℹ 40 more rows\n\n\nThe tricky part of choropleth maps is getting the shapes (polygons) that make up the regions. This is really a pretty complex set of lines for R to draw!\nLuckily, some maps are already created in R in the maps package.\n\nlibrary(maps)\nus_states &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\nhead(us_states)\n\n       long      lat group order  region subregion\n1 -87.46201 30.38968     1     1 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n2 -87.48493 30.37249     1     2 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n3 -87.52503 30.37249     1     3 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n4 -87.53076 30.33239     1     4 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n5 -87.57087 30.32665     1     5 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n6 -87.58806 30.32665     1     6 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n\n# Note that points in the same \"group\" are connected with a line\n\nus_states |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,\n                          group = group)) + \n  geom_polygon(fill = \"white\", color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\nOther maps provided by the maps package include US counties, France, Italy, New Zealand, and two different views of the world. If you want maps of other countries or regions, you can often find them online.\nSometimes maps may be provided as shapefiles. To use these, you’ll first need to read them into R and then turn them into tidy dataframes in order to use them with ggplot. See here:. More on shapefiles in Part 2.\nWhere the really cool stuff happens is when we join our data to the us_states dataframe. Notice that the state name appears in the “region” column of us_states, and that the state name is in all small letters. In vacc_mar13, the state name appears in the State column and is in title case. Thus, we have to be very careful when we join the state vaccine info to the state geography data.\nRun this line by line to see what it does:\n\nvacc_mar13 &lt;- vacc_mar13 |&gt;\n  mutate(State = str_to_lower(State))\n\nvacc_mar13 |&gt;\n  right_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\")) |&gt;\n  rename(region = State) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,\n                          group = group)) + \n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = people_vaccinated_per100), color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\noops, New York appears to be a problem.\n\nvacc_mar13 |&gt;\n  anti_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\"))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  State          Date       people_vaccinated_per100 share_doses_used Governor\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;date&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 alaska         2021-03-13                     27.0            0.686 R       \n2 hawaii         2021-03-13                     22.8            0.759 D       \n3 new york state 2021-03-13                     21.7            0.764 D       \n\nus_states |&gt;\n  anti_join(vacc_mar13, by = c(\"region\" = \"State\")) |&gt;\n  count(region)\n\n                region   n\n1 district of columbia  10\n2             new york 495\n\n\n[Pause to ponder:] What did we learn by running anti_join() above?\nNotice that the us_states map also includes only the contiguous 48 states. This gives an example of creating really beautiful map insets for Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nvacc_mar13 &lt;- vacc_mar13 |&gt;\n  mutate(State = str_replace(State, \" state\", \"\"))\n\nvacc_mar13 |&gt;\n  anti_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\"))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  State  Date       people_vaccinated_per100 share_doses_used Governor\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;date&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   \n1 alaska 2021-03-13                     27.0            0.686 R       \n2 hawaii 2021-03-13                     22.8            0.759 D       \n\nus_states |&gt;\n  anti_join(vacc_mar13, by = c(\"region\" = \"State\")) %&gt;%\n  count(region)\n\n                region  n\n1 district of columbia 10\n\n\nBetter.\n\nlibrary(viridis) # for color schemes\nvacc_mar13 |&gt;\n  right_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\")) |&gt;\n  rename(region = State) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,\n                          group = group)) + \n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = people_vaccinated_per100), color = \"black\") + \n  labs(fill = \"People Vaccinated\\nper 100 pop.\") +\n  # This scales the longitude and latitude so that the shapes look correct.\n  coord_map() + \n  # This theme can give you a really clean look!\n  theme_void() +  \n  # you can change the fill scale for different color schemes.\n  scale_fill_viridis() \n\n\n\n\n[Pause to ponder:] Use autofill to play with different themes and scale_fills.\nNote: Map projections are actually pretty complicated, especially if you’re looking at large areas (e.g. world maps). It’s impossible to preserve both shape and area when projecting a sphere onto a flat surface, so that’s why you sometimes see such different maps of the world\nThere are a few different options in coord_map(). See the help menu, although this function is being phased out.\nYou can also use a categorical variable to color regions:\n\nvacc_mar13 |&gt;\n  right_join(us_states, by = c(\"State\" = \"region\")) |&gt;\n  rename(region = State) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,\n                          group = group)) + \n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = Governor), color = \"darkgrey\", linewidth = 0.2) + \n  labs(fill = \"Governor\") +\n  # This scales the longitude and latitude so that the shapes look correct.\n  coord_map() + \n  # This theme can give you a really clean look!\n  theme_void() +  \n  # you can change the fill scale for different color schemes.\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"red\")) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple maps!\n[Pause to ponder:] are we bothered by the warning about many-to-many when you run the code below?\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\nweekly_vacc &lt;- vaccine_data |&gt;\n  mutate(State = str_to_lower(State)) |&gt;\n  mutate(State = str_replace(State, \" state\", \"\"),\n         week = week(Date)) |&gt;\n  group_by(week, State) |&gt;\n  summarize(date = first(Date),\n            mean_daily_vacc = mean(daily_vaccinated/est_population*1000)) |&gt;\n  right_join(us_states, by =c(\"State\" = \"region\")) |&gt;\n  rename(region = State)\n\nweekly_vacc |&gt;\n  filter(week &gt; 2, week &lt; 11) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,\n                          group = group)) + \n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = mean_daily_vacc), color = \"darkgrey\", size = 0.1) + \n  labs(fill = \"Weekly Average Daily Vaccinations per 1000\") +\n  coord_map() + \n  theme_void() + \n  scale_fill_viridis() + \n  facet_wrap(~date) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther cool state maps\n\nstatebin (square representation of states)\n\nlibrary(statebins) # may need to install\n\nvacc_mar13 |&gt;\n  mutate(State = str_to_title(State)) |&gt;\n  statebins(state_col = \"State\",\n            value_col = \"people_vaccinated_per100\") + \n  # one nice layout.

The original graph is located here.\n\n\n\nInteractive map with leaflet\nWith leaflet, you can have “pop-up” messages when you hover over points, and have a zoom-in and zoom-out option. Leaflet is not part of the tidyverse, but the structure of its code is pretty similar.\nTwo main features: addTiles() = Add background map setView() = Set where the map should originally zoom to\n\n# This part is for the pop-up messages.... some are weird or just \"\\n\" for example, so this turns the weird stuff to blanks.

Just hit the Download Raw File button.\n\nDeterminants of COVID vaccination rates\nA recent Stat 272 project examined determinants of covid vaccination rates at the county level. Our data set contains 3053 rows (1 for each county in the US) and 14 columns; here is a quick description of the variables we’ll be using:\n\nstate = state the county is located in\ncounty = name of the county\nregion = region the state is located in\nmetro_status = Is the county considered “Metro” or “Non-metro”?\nrural_urban_code = from 1 (most urban) to 9 (most rural)\nperc_complete_vac = percent of county completely vaccinated as of 11/9/21\ntot_pop = total population in the county\nvotes_Trump = number of votes for Trump in the county in 2020\nvotes_Biden = number of votes for Biden in the county in 2020\nperc_Biden = percent of votes for Biden in the county in 2020\ned_somecol_perc = percent with some education beyond high school (but not a Bachelor’s degree)\ned_bachormore_perc = percent with a Bachelor’s degree or more\nunemployment_rate_2020 = county unemployment rate in 2020\nmedian_HHincome_2019 = county’s median household income in 2019\n\n\nConsider only Minnesota and its surrounding states (Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota). We want to examine the relationship between the percentage who voted for Biden and the percentage of complete vaccinations by state. Generate two plots to examine this relationship:\n\n\nA scatterplot with points and smoothers colored by state. Make sure the legend is ordered in a meaningful way, and include good labels on your axes and your legend. Also leave off the error bars from your smoothers.\nOne plot per state containing a scatterplot and a smoother.\n\nDescribe which plot you prefer and why. What can you learn from your preferred plot?\n\nWe wish to compare the proportions of counties in each region with median household income above the national median ($69,560).\n\n\nFill in the blanks below to produce a segmented bar plot with regions ordered from highest proportion above the median to lowest.\nCreate a table of proportions by region to illustrate that your bar plot in (a) is in the correct order (you should find two regions that are really close when you just try to eyeball differences).\nExplain why we can replace fct_relevel(region, FILL IN CODE) with\n\nmutate(region_sort = fct_reorder(region, median_HHincome_2019 &lt; 69560, .fun = mean))\nbut not\nmutate(region_sort = fct_reorder(region, median_HHincome_2019 &lt; 69560))\n\nvaccine_data |&gt;\n  mutate(HHincome_vs_national = ifelse(median_HHincome_2019 &lt; 69560, FILL IN CODE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(region_sort = fct_relevel(region, FILL IN CODE)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = region_sort, fill = HHincome_vs_national)) +\n    geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\nWe want to examine the distribution of total county populations and then see how it’s related to vaccination rates.\n\n\nCarefully and thoroughly explain why the two histograms below provide different plots.\n\n\nvaccine_data |&gt;\n  mutate(tot_pop_millions = tot_pop / 1000000) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = tot_pop_millions)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 40) +\n    labs(x = \"Total population in millions\")\n\n\n\nvaccine_data |&gt;\n  mutate(tot_pop_millions = tot_pop %/% 1000000) |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = tot_pop_millions)) +\n    geom_histogram(bins = 40) +\n    labs(x = \"Total population in millions\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the top 5 counties in terms of total population.\nPlot a histogram of logged population and describe this distribution.\nPlot the relationship between log population and percent vaccinated using separate colors for Metro and Non-metro counties (be sure there’s no 3rd color used for NAs). Reduce the size and transparency of each point to make the plot more readable. Describe what you can learn from this plot.\n\n\nProduce 3 different plots for illustrating the relationship between the rural_urban_code and percent vaccinated. Hint: you can sometimes turn numeric variables into categorical variables for plotting purposes (e.g. as.factor(), ifelse()).\n\nState your favorite plot, why you like it better than the other two, and what you can learn from your favorite plot.\n\nBEFORE running the code below, sketch the plot that will be produced by R. AFTER running the code, describe what conclusion(s) can we draw from this plot?\n\n\nvaccine_data |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(perc_Biden)) |&gt;\n  mutate(big_states = fct_lump(state, n = 10)) |&gt;\n  group_by(big_states) |&gt;\n  summarize(IQR_Biden = IQR(perc_Biden)) |&gt;\n  mutate(big_states = fct_reorder(big_states, IQR_Biden)) |&gt;\n  ggplot() + \n    geom_point(aes(x = IQR_Biden, y = big_states))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this question we will focus only on the 12 states in the Midwest (i.e. where region == “Midwest”).\n\n\nCreate a tibble with the following information for each state. Order states from least to greatest state population.\n\n\nnumber of different rural_urban_codes represented among the state’s counties (there are 9 possible)\ntotal state population\nproportion of Metro counties\nmedian unemployment rate\n\n\nUse your tibble in (a) to produce a plot of the relationship between proportion of Metro counties and median unemployment rate. Points should be colored by the number of different rural_urban_codes in a state, but a single linear trend should be fit to all points. What can you conclude from the plot?\n\n\nGenerate an appropriate plot to compare vaccination rates between two subregions of the US: New England (which contains the states Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island) and the Upper Midwest (which, according to the USGS, contains the states Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa). What can you conclude from your plot?\n\nIn this next section, we consider a few variables that could have been included in our data set, but were NOT. Thus, you won’t be able to write and test code, but you nevertheless should be able to use your knowledge of the tidyverse to answer these questions.\nHere are the hypothetical variables:\n\nHR_party = party of that county’s US Representative (Republican, Democrat, Independent, Green, or Libertarian)\npeople_per_MD = number of residents per doctor (higher values = fewer doctors)\nperc_over_65 = percent of residents over 65 years old\nperc_white = percent of residents who identify as white\n\n\nHypothetical R chunk #1:\n\n\n# Hypothetical R chunk 1\ntemp &lt;- vaccine_data |&gt;\n  mutate(new_perc_vac = ifelse(perc_complete_vac &gt; 95, NA, perc_complete_vac),\n         MD_group = cut_number(people_per_MD, 3)) |&gt;\n  group_by(MD_group) |&gt;\n  summarise(n = n(),\n            mean_perc_vac = mean(new_perc_vac, na.rm = TRUE),\n            mean_white = mean(perc_white, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nDescribe the tibble temp created above. What would be the dimensions? What do rows and columns represent?\nWhat would happen if we replaced new_perc_vac = ifelse(perc_complete_vac &gt; 95, NA, perc_complete_vac) with new_perc_vac = ifelse(perc_complete_vac &gt; 95, perc_complete_vac, NA)?\nWhat would happen if we replaced mean_white = mean(perc_white, na.rm = TRUE) with mean_white = mean(perc_white)?\nWhat would happen if we removed group_by(MD_group)?\n\n\nHypothetical R chunk #2:\n\n\n# Hypothetical R chunk 2\nggplot(data = vaccine_data) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = perc_over_65, y = perc_complete_vac, \n                           color = HR_party)) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\ntemp &lt;- vaccine_data |&gt;\n  group_by(HR_party) |&gt;\n  summarise(var1 = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(var1)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 3)\n\nvaccine_data |&gt;\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = fct_reorder(HR_party, perc_over_65, .fun = median), \n                       y = perc_over_65)) +\n    geom_boxplot()\n\n\nWhy would the first plot produce an error?\nDescribe the tibble temp created above.

    "text": "Version Control (GitHub)\nIn order to collaborate on an R project (or any coding project in general), data scientists typically use a version control system like GitHub. With GitHub, you never have to save files as Final.docx, Final2.docx, Newfinal.docx, RealFinal.docx, nothisisreallyit.docx, etc. You update code like .qmd and .Rmd and data files, recording descriptions of any changes. Then if you ever want to go back to an earlier version, GitHub can facilitate that. Or if you want to make your work public, others can see it and even suggest changes, but you are ultimately in control of any changes that get made.\nAnd, you can have multiple collaborators with access to the same set of files. While it can be dicey if multiple people have the file open and make changes at the same time, if you do this with GitHub, it is at least POSSIBLE to get it straightened out, and the second person who tries to save will get warned. If you are both just using a common folder on RStudio, you can easily write over and erase each other’s work. (If you use a common folder, be sure that one person is editing at a time to prevent this).\nIn order to begin to get familiar with GitHub, we will use it to create a personal website.\n\n\nGetting started on GitHub and connecting to RStudio\n\nCreate a GitHub account at github.com. It’s usually okay to hit “Skip Personalization” at the bottom of the screen after entering an email, username, and password. There are a few bonuses you can get as a student that you might consider.\nObtain a personal access token in GitHub using the following steps:\n\nClick your profile picture/symbol in the upper right of your GitHub page. Then select Settings &gt; Developer settings &gt; Personal access tokens &gt; Tokens (classic).\nClick “Generate new token” and give a descriptive name like “My PAT for RStudio”. Note that the default expiration is 30 days; I did a Custom setting through the end of the semester.\nSelect scopes and permissions; I often select: repo, workflow, gist, and user.\nClick “Generate token”. Copy your personal access token and store it somewhere.\n\nStore your credentials in RStudio using the following steps:\n\nIn the console, type library(credentials). You might have to install the credentials package first.\nThen type set_github_pat(), hit Return, choose the Token option, and copy in your personal access token\n\n\n\n\nCreating an R project (local) that’s connected to GitHub (cloud)\n\nIn your GitHub account, click the \\(+ \\nabla\\) (+down arrow) button near the top right and select New Repository (repo). For a personal website, you might put something like “proback.github.io” for your repository (repo) name, where you should replace proback with your GitHub user name. For other repos, choose simple but descriptive names that should avoid spaces. Be sure Public is checked; often I create Private repositories and turn them Public if I want later, but we know a personal webpage should be Public. Check Add a ReadMe File. Finally hit Create Repository and copy the URL once your repo has been created; the URL should be something like github.com/user_name/user_name.github.io.\nGo into your RStudio and select File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control &gt; Git. For the repository URL paste in the URL for the repository you just created. A project directory named “user_name.github.io” will be created in your specified folder (which you can navigate to).\n\nNotice that you are now starting with a blank slate! Nothing in the environment or history. Also note where it says your project name in the top right corner.\n\n\nCreating a personal website in RStudio (local)\n\nFollow the instructions here. These instructions use materials from Brianna Heggeseth at Macalester, Joyce Robbins at Columbia, and quarto documentation.\n\n\n\nPushing your work to GitHub (cloud)\n\nWe now want to “push” the changes made in “user_name.github.io” to your GitHub repo (the changes have only been made in your local RStudio for now).\n\nIn the console, type library(credentials)\nThen type set_github_pat(), hit Return, and copy in your personal access token. We do this again because we are in a new project. (These first two steps might not be necessary, but it’s good to make sure.)\nunder the Git tab in the Environment panel, check the boxes in front of all modified files to “stage” your changes. To select a large number of files, check the top box, scroll down to the bottom of the list, and then shift-click the final box\nclick the Commit tab to “commit” your changes (like saving a file locally) along with a message describing the changes you made. GitHub guides you by by showing your old code (red) and new code (green), to make sure you approve of the changes. This first time, all code should be green since we’ve only added new things rather than modifying previously saved files.\n“push” your changes to GitHub (an external website) by clicking the green Up arrow. Refresh your GitHub account to see new files in the user_name.github.io repo!\n\n\n\n\nModifying files that have already been pushed to GitHub\n\nMake a change (anything) to one of your files in RStudio. Now go back under the Git tab and “push” these new changes to GitHub. You’ll have to go through the same process of Stage, Commit, and Push, although this time you’ll see only your newest changes in green when you Commit. Confirm that your changes appear in GitHub.\n\n\n\nPulling work from GitHub\nBefore you start a new session of working on a project in RStudio, you should always Pull changes from GitHub first. Most of the time there will be nothing new, but if a collaborator made changes since the last time you worked on a file, you want to make sure you’re working with the latest and greatest version. If not, you’ll end up trying to Push changes made to an old version, and GitHub will balk and produce Merge Conflict messages. We’ll see how to handle Merge Conflicts later, but it’s a bit of a pain and best avoided!\n\nGo into one of your files on GitHub and hit the Edit icon. Add a line anywhere, and then scroll down to hit Commit Changes. (This is not recommended and for illustrative purposes only! You typically won’t edit directly in GitHub, but we’re emulating what might happen if a collaborator makes changes since the last time you worked on a document.) Now go back to RStudio and, under the Git tab, “Pull” the changes from GitHub into your R project folder. (Use the blue Down arrow). Confirm that your changes now appear in RStudio. Before you start working on the R server, you should always Pull any changes that might have been made on GitHub (especially if you’re working on a team!), since things can get dicey if you try to merge new changes from RStudio with new changes on GitHub.\n\n\n\nA bit more about R projects\n\nTo see the power of projects, select File &gt; Close Project and Don’t Save the workspace image. Then, select File &gt; Recent Projects &gt; user_name.github.io; you will get a clean Environment and Console once again, but History shows the commands you ran by hand, active Rmd and qmd files appear in the Source panel, and Files contains the Rmd, qmd, html, and csv files produced by your last session. And you can stage, commit and push the changes and the new file to GitHub!"
