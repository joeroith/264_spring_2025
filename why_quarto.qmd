As described in the [quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html): Quarto is a multi-language, next generation version of R Markdown from RStudio, with many new features and capabilities. Like R Markdown, Quarto uses Knitr to execute R code, and is therefore able to render most existing Rmd files without modification.

Data scientists are [pretty excited](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3666743/what-is-quarto-rstudio-quietly-rolls-out-next-generation-r-markdown.html) about the introduction of Quarto, and since it represents the future of R Markdown, we will conduct SDS 264 using Quarto.  Intriguing Quarto features that have been cited include:

- collaborate across coding languages
- open source 
- dozens of export types, including websites, books, and blogs
- built-in YAML assistance (since it's a notoriously finicky language)
- it's installed like other software and automatically included in new versions of RStudio
- free publishing through quartopub.com
- while Rmd will be maintained and updated, cool new features will appear in Quarto
- there are plans for future simultaneous editing like in google docs


Here's a cool example from the Quarto documentation, showing features like cross-referencing of figures, chunk options using the hash-pipe format, collapsed code, and easy figure legends:

## Air Quality

@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: "Temperature and ozone level."
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```
